# Hi, I'm Luis, know me a bit more :)

I'm a 30 years Old, with a degree on _Electrical Engenieer_ ‚ö°Ô∏è. I have a deep understanding on how computers work from the very deep of them `(I loved boolean functions ‚ô•Ô∏è)`.
Once I graduated I learned how to code PLC for a master on Industrial Automatization but later on I discovered that I actually wanted to learn how to code anything.

I decided to start my own projects, which lead me to my foundations as **SELF-TAUGHT** Developer through the years. Jumping between different programming languages like JavaScript, Python or GoLang.
These all were applied differently through the years and looking for a more scalable way to develop my applications I learned **Architectures** and common methodologies for my Job.

A interested thing about me is that I also loved trading, how complex was the market and I decided to go deep into the **algorithms**, which developed in me a different point of view for complex tasks and finding the solutions for all of them.

I never give up in front of a problem, and I'm always looking to learn new technologies and new paths. Like when the time for me to meet **AWS** or **GCP** came and the necesity for **Github** and their control sources.
Or when I had to learn about the **Linux Command Line** to start installing **Nginx** on small servers as a reverse proxy and start my very first deployments.

Through the years I focused on **SOLVING PROBLEMS** for business, and improving their **cost-benefit** tools. Which I had the opportunity to face with **MANY clients** on **FIVERR**.

I don't want to make my introduction too long, so I will list a bit of all the Language and Frameworks I have worked through the years üöÄ

- TypeScript

_Probably I'm forgetting something so If you wonder If I'm capable to do anything else that's not in this list, the answer is probably yes, just haven't tried yet._
