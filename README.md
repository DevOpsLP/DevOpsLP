## Hi, I’m Luis Parada 👋

**Software Engineer | Backend-Focused | Systems & Architecture**

I’m a software engineer with a strong engineering foundation and a problem-driven mindset. My background combines **electrical engineering principles**, **systems thinking**, and **practical software architecture**, which allows me to design scalable, reliable solutions for real business needs.

I started my career working with **industrial automation and PLC programming**, which gave me a deep understanding of how systems behave at a low level. Over time, I transitioned fully into software development, becoming a **self-taught engineer** through years of building production systems, client solutions, and internal tools.

Today, my work focuses on **backend systems, APIs, data flows, and infrastructure**, with a strong emphasis on **correctness, scalability, and cost-efficiency**.

## What I Do

* Design and build **backend services and APIs**
* Architect **scalable systems** with clear data models
* Integrate **payment systems, third-party APIs, and automation**
* Optimize **cost, performance, and operational reliability**
* Deploy and maintain applications in **cloud and Linux environments**
* Solve complex problems with a **pragmatic, engineering-first approach**

I’m particularly interested in **algorithmic thinking**, **financial systems**, and **trading-related tooling**, which has sharpened my ability to reason about edge cases, risk, and system behavior under pressure.
